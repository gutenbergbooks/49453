<h2>Island Life and Color</h2>

<p>We landed at St. Thomas in front of a little square overhung by palm and mango
trees and shaded by lofty ferns, and were at once among a strange population.
The children were all dressed in black, as nature made them, with eyes that shone
like glass beads. Some of the native women were carrying trays of vegetables, fruit,
bread, or small wares upon their heads; others were squatting upon their heels, while
in front of them were little piles of sweet potatoes, peppers, limes, or a few sticks of
sugar-cane; others were hawking strings of shells and shining beans called “Job’s tears.”</p>

<p>If one climbs to the hill above the town of Charlotte Amalie, he obtains a charming
picture: high-colored villas form the foreground, the beautiful bay, with its ships
and little islands, occupies the middle distance, while beyond, across the blue
sea, are the shadowy forms of St. Croix and Porto Rico.</p>

<p>St. Croix is not so abrupt and severe as some of its associates, though it bears
abundant evidences of volcanic origin. It consists of a multitude of little peaks
and rounded hills, with ravines and valleys between them. The mountains,
where uncultivated, are a bluish green, but where the sugar-cane is largely grown, the
color of the country-side is so light and rich a green that it seems as if Spring had just
spread her mantle over the land. The plantations climb the hills and crown many of
them, and skirt precipices, and sweep their waves of golden-green down to kiss the
white sea-waves. There are long avenues of cocoa palms, with trunks rising fifty feet
like polished marble shafts, and then bursting out into a miracle of waving foliage
and nests of green cocoanuts.</p>

<p>Frederiksted and Christiansted are generally called “West End” and “Basse
(Low) End.” Our view of Frederiksted from the vessel had prepared us for
a beautiful place. It has some buildings with arched fronts and many white
and pink and yellow houses, half-hidden among the strange tamarind and palm and
mango trees, but when we got ashore the vision vanished. The arcades were clumsy
and crumbling, the streets unpaved and irregular, and the cabins where the negroes
lived were far from picturesque. They are built of wood and usually consist of one or
two rooms, in which a large family is huddled at night. The people spend most of the
daytime out of doors, and meals are prepared in the open air. There is no glass in
the windows, and wooden shutters serve to keep out the wind and rain.</p>

<p>Drives in the island of St. Croix over superb roads led us into valleys where
there were tamarind trees, delicate-leaved as our locust, and giants called flamboyants,
leafless but all aflame with scarlet flowers; and the silk cottonwood
with enormous misshapen roots and long horizontal branches, on which grew a multitude
of parasites and air plants. Here, too, was the curiously formed frangipani, with hooked
or claw-like branches, and the banana tree, with clustering fruit and huge and cone-like
blossom. Flowers of all colors and shapes, from the fragrant white jasmine to the
yellow and red cacti, adorned the roadsides. Black pelicans floated on the sea, or sailed
in long and continuous flight through the air; the groves were never without modest
music from numbers of elegantly dressed birds, and innumerable brilliant butterflies
harmonized in the beauty of their coloring with the superb flowers upon which they fed.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Columbus, despairing of finding individual names
for all the islands he sighted, called the rocky archipelago
which is the subject of this number of The
Mentor, “‘The Virgin Islands,’ after Saint Ursula
and her martyred maidens.” The group designated by this
name includes upwards of fifty islands and islets, several of
which are owned by Great Britain. When
Spain ceded Porto Rico, ownership of three
of the Virgin Islands&mdash;Vieques, Culebra,
and Culebrita&mdash;passed to the United
States. St. Croix is not one of this group,
according to strict geographical classification,
but, together with the Virgin Islands,
is one of the Leeward Islands group,
which comprises, among others, St. Kitts,
Nevis, St. Christopher, Antigua, Guadaloupe
and Martinique.</p>

<p>Over a century and a half after Columbus
discovered the Virgin Islands, in 1493,
adventurous Danes cast anchor in the harbor
of St. Thomas, but soon forsook this
little isle of the southern seas for another
island at the mouth of the Hudson River&mdash;the
Island of Manhattan, where the
Dutch had settled. The Dutch and the
English, the French and the Spanish, had
previously visited the islands we call St.
Thomas and St. Croix when, in 1666, the
Danish made another unsuccessful attempt
at colonization. Six years later, the Danish
West India and Guinea Company fathered
a settlement from which descended all
later colonies.</p>

<p>By the year 1680, over three hundred
settlers were established on St. Thomas.
The principal industry was the raising of
tobacco. Half the population was composed
of slaves. To further increase their
number, King Christian V of Denmark
decreed that natives of Africa be brought
across-seas in ships specially engaged in
slave traffic. All the European countries
that had undertaken to develop the agricultural
resources of the West India Islands
had found after repeated disasters that
only black men were fitted to work in the
tropics. Besides tobacco, estates were now
planted with sugar cane, sprouts of which
were obtained from Tortola, another island
of the Virgin group, twenty miles east of
St. John, and owned by the British.</p>

<p>The British still had a jealous eye on the
fine harbor of St. Thomas, and to prevent
attacks by them and by the French, who
had taken St. Croix from the Spanish in
1650, the Government of Denmark built,
about 1690, a fort and a thick-walled
tower overlooking the bay and its peaked
islands. In 1701, a priest, Father Labat,
made a voyage to the islands of America
and wrote a book that contained the first
lengthy description of the well-cared-for
estates, the streets and neat houses of St.
Thomas. Europe being then at war, and
Denmark a neutral nation, this broad
haven at the crossroads of travel was the
refuge of ships escaping pursuit, and
boasted a brisk commerce. Many tales of
piracy date from these rousing days of
trade and warfare.</p>

<p>St. John was permanently settled by the
Danes in 1716. The French, Knights of
Malta, and “miscellaneous rovers” occupied
the island of St. Croix, thirty-five
miles south of St. Thomas until, in 1733,
France sold it to Denmark. King Frederick
V, in 1755, purchased the Danish
West India Company’s land, forts, buildings,
slaves, merchandise and ships for
$1,500,000, and made St. Thomas a closed
port. However, within a decade the
former policy as to world commerce was
resumed by order of the king, and during
the pre-Napoleonic wars St. Thomas was
the meeting-place of vessels flying the pennants
of all the warring nations. “Things
were lively in those days,” writes Mr.
Luther Zabriskie. “Money flowed like
water into the coffers of the merchants.
Population increased, the town limits
were extended, stores and dwellings were
rapidly built, and thousands of refugees
and adventurers sought these shores for
the purpose of traffic.”</p>

<p>But St. Thomas was not to remain a
neutral port for long. In 1801, England
blockaded the island and held it for ten
months. The British flag again flew over
the islands between the years 1807 and
1815, as a precaution against seizure by
Napoleon. In the readjustment of nations
following the events of the latter
year, the group was restored to Denmark.
Once more, St. Thomas became the queen
port of the West Indies, and exacted tribute
from the hundreds of ships that plied
this golden lane of commerce between the
Atlantic and the Pacific. On the birth
date of American Independence, July 4,
1848, the black bondmen of the Danish
West Indies were freed by decree of the
Crown, and forthwith they forsook their
agricultural occupations. The prosperity
of the Danish islands was affected when
profits decreased in the production of cane
sugar. The abolition of slavery and the
development of the beet sugar industry
both had a share in bringing about this
condition. Formerly, St. Thomas had
been the sole port of call for steamers carrying
cargoes of goods that were in demand
on neighboring islands, including Porto
Rico. Now other lines of transportation
were organized, and direct communication
was established between Porto Rico
and the north. By the year 1866, planters
and officials of the Government were ready
to consider the proposals of Secretary
Seward that the islands should become the
property of the United States.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The need of the United States for a naval base to prevent
blockade-running during the Civil War influenced
President Lincoln and Secretary Seward to
urge the purchase of the Danish West Indies, in
order to obtain the rights to the harbor of St. Thomas. Actual
negotiations were not undertaken, however, till after Lincoln’s
assassination. The first proposals were
made to Denmark when she was smarting
under the loss of Schleswig and Holstein,
after the victory of her Teuton enemies.
Secretary Seward visited the islands in the
year 1866, and offered five million dollars
for the group. But Denmark hesitated to
conclude arrangements, lest she displease
her victors. Furthermore, Napoleon III
refused his consent to the transfer of St.
Croix, and according to the agreement entered
into at the time of the purchase of
St. Croix from France, Denmark could not
dispose of this island to any other country
without the approval of the original
owner.</p>

<p>Seven and a half million dollars was the
price finally named in 1867 for the two
northern islands, and the Danish Senate
and the inhabitants of the island voted in
favor of the transaction. In the United
States Senate the chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee was Charles Sumner.
As an opponent of President Johnson,
it is believed he feared the purchase
of the Danish West Indies, following the
Alaska purchase, would bring too great
popular favor to the Administration. At
any rate, no action was taken on the
treaty when it was presented. The opposition
of Sumner to the Grant administration
further delayed ratifications, and, in
1870, the treaty was allowed to lapse.</p>

<p>The Danes again showed themselves
willing to sell the islands during the presidency
of Harrison and Cleveland, but met
no response on the part of the United
States. After the Spanish-American War,
proposals were again renewed. A treaty
was drawn up by John Hay in 1901, and
the purchase price fixed at five million
dollars for the three islands, St. Croix
being included by consent of France. The
United States Senate confirmed the second
treaty in February, 1902, but this time
the Upper House of the Danish Parliament
failed to ratify. German influence in
Denmark was held accountable for this
attitude, since German steamship interests
would be furthered by the retention of the
islands by Denmark.</p>

<p>In 1911, the transfer was once more
broached, but again it failed of consummation.
The question last came up for discussion
in August, 1916, and again negotiations
would have been fruitless but for
the insistence of the Danish premier, who
threatened to dissolve parliament and participate
a general election if Government
and people did not consent to the disposal
of the islands. On January 17, 1917,
terms were finally concluded between the
two countries.</p>

<p>At a farewell service held in St. Thomas
after the ratification of the treaty of cession
had been exchanged by Secretary Lansing
and the Danish Minister at Washington,
the pastor paid this just tribute to the rule of
Old Denmark, that had lasted, almost
without interruption, for nearly two hundred
and fifty years: “Of what are our
thoughts, now that the end is reached?
Of oppression and misrule? Exploited resources?
A people crippled with taxes to
enrich others? Education systematically
neglected? The rule of the few over the
many? Justice sold to the highest bidder?
Government without heart or sympathy
with the poor? Any or all of these things
so often the accompaniment of colonial
rule? No. At the bar of history the account
is rendered. Today we may think
of the solid good of the past, and pray
that the new flag shall stand for all those
things for which the old flag has stood.”</p>

<p>On March 3, 1917, an act was approved
by the United States Congress to provide
a temporary government for the people of
the Danish West Indies, and on the last
day of that month the formal transfer was
sealed by the payment of a treasury warrant
of $25,000,000 by the United States
Secretary of State to the Danish Minister
in Washington. Telegraphic advice was
immediately sent to representatives of the
two Governments at St. Thomas. Upon
receipt of the messages the ceremony of
the transfer was enacted at the Saluting
Battery, St. Thomas, by the retiring Danish
governor and the acting United States
governor (commander of the U. S. S. <i>Hancock</i>),
in the presence of naval, military
and civil guards and an impressive assemblage
of citizens. The transfer was simultaneously
celebrated at Christiansted and
Frederiksted, St. Croix. On April 7, 1917,
the first governor of the islands, Rear
Admiral Pollock, late Chief of Naval Intelligence,
was officially welcomed and installed
in office.</p>

<p>The inquiry, “Are the islands worth the
expenditure of $25,000,000?”, is answered
by present-day students of naval tactics.
“We have at least the value of the twenty-five
millions in these offensive times in
keeping any foreign power from getting a
foothold there. We have bought the finest
site strategically, logistically and tactically
for a first-class naval base on the Atlantic
seaboard.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Under the old régime the executive power of the
Danish Islands was vested in a governor appointed
by the king. For six months of the year his residence
was on St. Thomas; for the rest of the year
it was on St. Croix, thirty-five miles distant. St. Thomas and
St. John comprised one political part, St. Croix another. Two
colonial councils made the laws, a proportion
of the members being appointed by
the Government, and the remainder being
elected by the islanders for a term of four
years. Besides, there was a Danish police
force that presented a brave appearance
on dress occasions in uniforms of pale blue
and white, with high hats crowned by
bright red pompoms. Danish judges were
appointed for life. The whipping-post, we
are told, still menaced offenders under Old
Country rule, and heavy penalties were
visited upon natives convicted of theft.
Males twenty-five years of age, born on the
islands, or resident there for five years,
who were possessed of a stipulated amount
of property and were of unassailable character,
were entitled to the franchise. As
far as possible, the Danish Colonial Law
affecting the islands will be maintained by
the United States.</p>

<p>The Colonial Treasury supported the
Evangelical Lutheran Church as the national
church of Denmark, though various
other denominations were and continue to
be represented in the islands. Lutheran
and Reformed Dutch congregations have
worshipped on St. Thomas for over two
centuries. Missionaries of the Moravian
Church began their ministrations in the
year 1732, and, under Government subsidy,
have had an important share in the
education of the island children, both
black and white. The education of Roman
Catholic children has been in the
hands of the Catholic Church. Free schools
and schoolbooks were provided by the
Danish Government. Denmark’s liberality
is exampled in the fact that though
both Danish and English were taught, the
study of Danish was not compulsory.
Though Danish has been the official language,
English has long been that of the
people. Under United States control it is
likely that American teachers will replace
some inefficient native black teachers, as
has been done with excellent results in
Porto Rico. Under the Danes, the school
year was twelve months long, all children
between the ages of seven and thirteen
being required to attend classes six
days a week, three hours a day. Morning
hours were reserved for the session of the
lower grades and the later sessions for the
upper grades. Three weeks’ vacation was
permitted in September. The high percentage
of literacy in the islands may in
part be credited to a system of fines in
force for many years. Unless officially
excused, a pupil arriving an hour late at
school was subject to a fine of one to five
cents. For a day’s absence without permission
a fine was imposed of ten cents for
the first day and five cents for each additional
day of absence. The fine for absence
from examinations was fixed at fifty
cents for each offence. According to Government
statistics, all but a very small proportion
of the islands’ inhabitants can
both read and write. The Danish system
of education will to a great extent be continued
by the United States, exclusive of
denominational training. There are no
high schools in the islands. On St. Thomas
there are two private academies.</p>

<p>The abolition of slavery and the prominence
of St. Thomas as a port have so impeded
the development of the island’s natural
resources that today most of the produce
consumed by St. Thomians is imported
from nearby islands and from the
United States. Farm laborers are given
thirty-five cents a day, but as dock laborers
a dollar a day can be earned. On St.
John the soil is used for the cultivation of
bay and lime trees, and a few hundred head
of cattle find grazing ground on the hilly
slopes. Thirteen thousand acres on the
island of St. Croix are devoted to the growing
of sugar cane, 2,000 acres to cotton, and
30,000 acres to a variety of crops chiefly
useful for cattle fodder. Consular reports
give the main manufacturing industries of
the islands as sugar, rum and molasses on
St. Croix; bay rum on St. Thomas; bay
oil, bay rum and the products of the lime
tree on St. John.</p>

<p>The hurricane of October 9, 1916, was
the most disastrous to real estate and commerce
that had been experienced in the
islands since 1867, the loss being estimated
at about $1,500,000. The full force of the
wind fell upon St. Thomas, though the
greatest number of deaths&mdash;about fifty in
all&mdash;were reported from St. John. The
accustomed signals&mdash;two guns fired at a
short interval&mdash;gave warning early in the
afternoon of the approaching high winds.
Accompanied by heavy rain, the wind
blew at the rate of 125 miles an hour. It
bared hills of turf and trees, lifted houses
from foundations, wiped out villages, laid
cocoanut groves low, stripped bay trees of
their leaves, destroyed oil stills and sunk
ships in the harbors, or drove them ashore
and left them but disordered piles of wood
and metal. On June 25th of each year it
is the custom of the islanders to hold
services of prayer to ask protection from
the raging trade-winds that blow across
the Atlantic from southwestern Europe,
and on October 25th they give thanks if
the prayer has been answered.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Since the age of the discoverers, the harbor of St.
Thomas has welcomed the craft of the sea-going
nations of Europe&mdash;craft sometimes black of prow
and sinister in design. Father Labat recounts the
tale of a French privateer, Legendre the Blond, who on an
autumn day in 1695 ran into the harbor at Charlotte Amalie,
robbed the Brandenburgh warehouse of
24,000 riksdollars (about $13,000), and relieved
the employees, from director-general
to humblest clerk, of everything
except the shirts they wore. Accomplices
of French privateers, with the connivance
of authorities at St. Thomas, once sent a
warning that enabled a robber fleet to
reach France with a sum equivalent to
$400,000 stolen on the British island of
New Granada to enrich the war chest of
Louis XIV. In April, 1699, there arrived
a notorious “rover of the sea” at the harbor
gate of St. Thomas. “Well outside gun
range,” he hove to, and asked refuge from
the pursuit of English ships. It was none
other than Captain Kidd that begged this
hospitality, and a governor of less tolerant
ideas than some others that had represented
Denmark refused him admission.
Later, when the pirate secretly disposed
of his ill-gained cargo to island traders,
part of it&mdash;tens of bales of fine muslin
valued at 12,000 pieces of eight&mdash;was
stored in a St. Thomas warehouse. Captain
Kidd departed for New York, and
from there was sent to England for trial
on the charge of piracy. The taller of the
two towers on the hills behind Charlotte
Amalie is the traditional stronghold of
Black Beard Edward Teach, “one of the
realest, blackest and bloodiest pirates that
ever graced the Spanish Main. He came
to his own at the cutlass of his Majesty’s
Lieutenant Maynard in the year
1718.” Forty-five bays on the coast of
St. Thomas and thirty inlets that indent
the shore of St. John were in those days
a well-considered aid to the dark dealings
of men and ships.</p>

<p>It was at Magen’s Bay, a large inlet on
the north side of St. Thomas, that surveys
recently made by the American Indian-Heye
Foundation of New York uncovered
the remains of a primitive settlement.
Vessels found in burial mounds were without
decoration, and were in other ways unlike
those that have descended to us from
the first inhabitants of Porto Rico and
San Domingo. Archeologists accept this
as proof that the aborigines of the newly-acquired
American group were not Arawaks,
as previously supposed; nor do the
crafts disclosed by research reflect the Carib
culture of the West Indian islands farther
south. As yet, the tribe that hunted the
cottonwood groves of St. Thomas, built
canoes and fished the swarming bays has
not been classified. It is hoped that future
excavation on the Virgin Islands of Great
Britain may aid identification. On the
island of St. John there are no indications
of aboriginal life beyond a few rock carvings,
from which evidence it is judged that
this island had no village site, but was
used for ceremonial meetings. On St.
Croix, ten village sites have been discovered
by various investigators.</p>

<p>Visitors to St. John find special interest
in the bay rum industry. Here the bay
tree is indigenous to the soil, no orchards
having been set out by man. Three times
a year the leaves are picked by nimble
youngsters, who throw down twigs bearing
perhaps a dozen leaves to women standing
ready with bags that have a capacity of
sixty to seventy pounds. Oil distillers pay
two cents a pound for the leaves and the
labor of picking them. When the essential
oil is extracted from the leaf, it is
mixed with rum or alcohol and water and
further distilled to make bay rum. The
latter process is mainly carried on by St.
Thomas firms. The average price of bay
oil in the islands is five dollars a quart; of
bay rum, seventy cents a gallon.</p>

<p>“If you love beautiful scenery,” says the
author of “Isles of Spice and Palm”&mdash;“if
you are interested in strange people and
quaint ways, visit that chain of island gems
which stretches in a broad curve from
Porto Rico to the tip of South America,
and which is known as the Lesser Antilles.
By days of travel these islands are close
at hand; by customs, manner and life they
are remote as the Antipodes.” Admiral
David Porter called St. Thomas “the keystone
to the arch of the West Indies.”
Transportation from New York to this
sunny isle of storied days and fortunate
location is by the Quebec Steamship
Line, which maintains comfortable ships
on regular nine or ten-day schedule. The
trip each way consumes a little over five
days. A call is also made at Frederiksted,
St. Croix, (and in the sugar season at
Christiansted), before the steamer proceeds
to South America. Between Charlotte
Amalie and San Juan, Porto Rico, a
voyage of about fifty miles, there is a
monthly steamer service. Fast sailing vessels
also carry passengers to and fro
among the islands.</p>

<p>Coral Bay, St. John, is twice as deep as
the hill-bound harbor of St. Thomas, and
is large enough to shelter at one time four
or five hundred vessels. It is actually a
better haven than that of St. Thomas,
but the latter is closer to the trade routes.
Before the World War it was not unusual
for two hundred ships to call in one year
at the port of Charlotte Amalie.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The island of Santa Cruz or Saint Croix (Holy Cross)
was so named by the Spanish and the French who
occupied it at different periods until the year 1733.
As the Knights of Malta, under grant from Louis
XIV, were for a decade in possession of this isolated domain,
the name has interesting associations. Not long after St.
Croix came under control of Denmark
there was born on the island of Nevis, fifty
miles away, the boy known to history as
Alexander Hamilton, son of a Scotch
merchant and a cultured lady of Huguenot
descent. At his mother’s death the child
was put in the care of relatives who lived
on St. Croix. Before he reached his teens
he was apprenticed in Frederiksted as a
counting-house clerk to the firm of Nicholas
Cruger. His youthful letters of business
and friendship are distinguished by
mature reasoning and elegant phrase. In
November, 1769, when twelve years of
age, he wrote a boy friend expressing impatience
with “the grovelling condition of
a clerk,” and avowed: “I would willingly
risk my life, though not my character, to
exalt my station.” The date, August 31,
1772, is memorable in St. Croix for a
furious hurricane that endured a third of
a day and made “the whole frame of nature
seem as though unhinged and tottering to
its fall.” The young clerk described this
disastrous visitation in a letter addressed
to his father on September 6th. “It
seemed as if a total dissolution of nature
was taking place,” he wrote. “The roaring
of the sea and wind,&mdash;fiery meteors flying
about in the air,&mdash;the prodigious glare of
almost perpetual lightning,&mdash;the crash of
falling houses, and the ear-piercing shrieks
of the distressed, were sufficient to strike
astonishment into angels. Misery in its
most hideous shapes spread over the face
of the country.” This letter, appearing in
a newspaper, aroused such interest in the
talents of the writer that a month later it
was arranged for him to sail for the American
Colonies and there continue his interrupted
studies in a grammar-school near
New York. Later, the youth entered
King’s College, now Columbia University.
At seventeen, having already allied himself
with the interests of the Americans, he
addressed with ardor and inventive argument
a great meeting of patriots assembled
in New York to act on the proposal to
hold a general congress of colonial representatives.</p>

<p>In Hamilton’s boyhood, St. Croix, a
sugar-producing island, shared the richest
commerce of the West Indies. The first
sugar plantations were laid out about the
middle of the eighteenth century; towns
named for Danish kings, Christian and
Frederik, were plotted, and good roads
built. The south side of the island is level
and well adapted for agriculture. Here
are many estates owned by corporations
that operate sugar factories.</p>

<p>As a resort, St. Croix has much to commend
it. The climate is warm and dry.
The daily variation of extremes of temperature
the year ’round is moderate. The
winter and early summer months are the
most agreeable for outdoor recreation.
August and September are the hottest
months, but prostrations from heat rarely
occur. In an average year, the maximum
temperature in summer is 92° F., and the
minimum 74° F. The normal maximum
winter temperature (in January) is 83° F.,
and the minimum 65° F. There is no malaria
in either St. Croix or St. Thomas. The
charming scenery of St. Croix is disclosed by
pleasant roads that wind among the sugar
plantations and up to the fields on the
slopes, where a high-grade sea island cotton
is successfully grown.</p>

<p>An English physician, long resident in
the islands, styles St. Croix, “The Garden
of the West Indies, on account of its
superior cultivation, its beautiful homes
and its fertility.” He says, “Its scenery
is extremely varied. To the lovers of dark
gloomy hills and large waste lagoons, the
eastern part of the island offers many attractions.
A rich, fruitful valley occupies
the central and most southerly portion of
the island. A drive through this, upon
the splendid road that runs from Christiansted
to Frederiksted, a distance of fifteen
miles, will amply reward anyone who
cares for picturesque scenery. On each
side are cocoanut trees, sometimes varied
by the areca palm. Between these and
behind them may be seen sugar-fields, perhaps
full of undulating cane ready for cutting.
A manager’s house peeps out from
a dark clump of mango and tamarind
trees. Hard by is the negro laborers’ village.
Cultivated to their very tops are
many of the hills. A windmill here and
there, and a glimpse now and then of
the sea, complete a landscape not often
seen outside of the tropics, and not often
seen outside of St. Croix.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">The people of the Virgin Islands, in the words of one
who knows them well, “are intelligent, agreeable,
and well-informed, and many of them are educated
and refined, though to a great extent deprived of
broadening influences through their isolation. They are peaceful
and industrious, and crimes of violence are unknown, but
they have needed capital for the development
of their resources and incentive.
From the standpoint of one who has lived
in the islands, I am frank to state that the
‘negro problem’ here will hardly be the
problem&mdash;difficult of solution&mdash;which at
first glance it seems to be; for while most
of the leading merchants, tradesmen and
minor officials are men in whose veins runs
colored blood, they are often more courteous
and considerate than those of white
skin occupying similar position in America.
Hospitality and good cheer abound everywhere,
and the prevailing atmosphere is
one of cheerfulness, now further stimulated
by reason of the transfer to the
United States. Class distinction rather
than color distinction exists.</p>

<p>“The laboring classes are generally
courteous and respectful, and with the
minimum of creature comforts enjoy life
as keenly as do those in the middle and
upper classes. We will not have the problem
of converting a hostile people to our
ideas of life and government, as was the
case in Porto Rico, where customs, language
and sentiment were adverse to us,
because not only is English the universal
language and the associations American,
but the people have ardently wanted
American rule, as was evidenced by the
popular vote in all the islands in favor of
the transfer. The great problem will be
to introduce necessary changes gradually,
and to furnish the laboring classes, under
prevailing wage conditions, with a livelihood
and a chance to develop in accordance
with modern ideas of labor. A cheerful and
hopeful people come under our government,
and a tolerant attitude on our part
will do much to cement a bond of friendship
and materialize a hope of years.”</p>

<p>The problems of St. Thomas and its
sister islands are complicated by the disinclination
of the negro population for
pursuits of the soil. We are told that
“looking out across the wide sweep of the
island of St. Thomas, one sees scarcely an
unruined habitation, and only a very few
patches of cultivation, whence come those
meager handfuls of vegetables seen of a
morning in the long sun-stricken market&mdash;vegetables
outlandish and twisted, as
though they had been wrung from the unwilling
earth in pain.” Wilbur Steele, a
recent traveler in the islands, says of the
natives that they no longer wish to till the
soil. “They have come back to the sea, and it
was coal that brought them. Standing on
the boat deck of the steamer alongside the
dock, one looks down upon a river of coal,
flowing ceaselessly, hour after hour,
through the hot day, taking its source
among the black tablelands beyond the
dock and emptying its burden in the vitals
of the ship underfoot. The river is perhaps
four feet wide, the width of two baskets
touching rims, each basket carrying
sixty to sixty-five pounds of coal, or a
comfortable load for a colored woman’s
head. Beneath it, as beneath the belly of
a Chinese dragon, one catches glimpses of
brown bare feet moving rhythmically.…
Afterward, when the work is done and
the vessel sated, they go away through the
town, as swaggering a crew of long-shore-women
as one would care to see, slapping
shoulders and calling names. They are
full of an exuberant gaiety which tons of
coal cannot crush.” Mr. Steele visualizes
for us a bit of Charlotte Amalie, pleasant to
remember: “A sun-drenched street with
a yellow pavement and close walls of pink
and violet and flame and ultramarine; big
studded doors set deep in recesses; windows
sealed with shutters the color of
malachite; and, of a sudden, the mouth
of a dark corridor leading away through
the internals of a great flat stucco block
and down into the glare of the street below.
There was something fascinating
about that intimate vista. Arch succeeded
upon Spanish arch, thick in masonry;
somewhere a lacework of sunshine
mysteriously procured, traced the floor of
the corridor; beyond it showed a dim net of
fronds and the ghost of a fountain&mdash;a world
languorous, remote, and self-contained.”</p>

<p>To this little world of dimmed glory and
future hopes, of adventure and opportunity,
the United States has fallen heir.
For its protection hundreds of American
Marines have already completed effective
fortifications on hills commanding the harbor
of St. Thomas, and the passage to the
Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Virgin Islands formerly known as the Danish West Indies
were purchased by the United States for the apparently exorbitant
sum of $25,000,000. While the group comprises more than
fifty islands, but three are inhabited. These are St. Thomas,
Santa Cruz or St. Croix (sahn krwah), and St. John.</p>

<p class="caption">Secretary Lansing handing Constantin Brun, the Danish Minister at Washington,
a Treasury Warrant for $25,000,000. The others in the group are Secretary
Daniels, Secretary McAdoo, and Rear-Admiral James H. Oliver, first appointee
to the Governorship of the Virgin Islands of the United States of America</p>
</div>

<p>Denmark received from the United States an average price of $295
per acre. Alaska was purchased at a cost of two cents per acre, and the
Philippine Islands cost us about twenty-seven cents per acre. For strategic,
economic and political reasons the Virgin Islands are worth far more
to us than their purchase price. We were in need of a naval base to protect
the Panama Canal, and the harbor at St. Thomas provides the best
naval station in the West Indies.</p>

<p>The islands were
discovered by Columbus
in 1493, on his
second voyage to the
New World. Since
then the inhabitants
have been under Spanish,
British, French,
Dutch and Danish rule.
For over two hundred
years the Danish
flag has flown above
these islands of the
Virgin group. Repeatedly
the United States
has tried to acquire
them. In 1865 Secretary
Seward offered
five millions of dollars,
which was increased
two years later to $7,500,000. Again,
in 1901, negotiations were entered
into with Denmark, but Germany
intervened, and once more the project
failed.</p>

<p>A price was finally agreed upon,
and the transfer of the islands took
place March 31, 1917. The ceremony
was most impressive, though
Governor Oliver, appointed by President
Wilson, could not arrive in time
to take part in it. Commander
Pollock, of the gunboat <i>Hancock</i>, was
at Santo Domingo and was ordered
to proceed at once to St. Thomas
and take possession in the name of
the United States. He arrived on the day of the ceremony, and was met
by the Danish governor, Danish officials, and officers and marines of the
Danish gunboat <i>Valkyrie</i>. In the presence of a large assemblage the Danish
flag came down after nearly two and a half centuries of rule, and the Stars
and Stripes was raised over the former Danish Government buildings,
over forts, and on various private flagstaffs. Many of the Danes were in
tears. A number of them had been born on the islands and knew no other
home. To them it was a sad event, but practically all realized that the
transfer was best for the people generally and for the future of the islands.</p>

<h3><i>The Commerce and People</i></h3>

<p>Besides Charlotte Amalie,
a town of about 8,000 inhabitants,
there are a few scattered
settlements on the island of
St. Thomas. Some years ago
the harbor was a free port and
Charlotte Amalie enjoyed a
considerable commerce. Immense
warehouses were built,
and merchants from Central
and South America came to
the island to purchase merchandise.
When the port was
no longer free, its commerce
gradually dwindled and the harbor was almost deserted. Ships called only
to go into drydock or to coal. It now remains for Uncle Sam to restore
its former trade with our sister republics to the south.</p>

<p class="caption">Beneath the walls of the fort on the water-front, Charlotte Amalie</p>
</div>

<p>Little or nothing grows on the island of St. Thomas, and from an
agricultural standpoint it offers but few opportunities. Its inhabitants,
aside from about two hundred whites, are all negroes. The Danes were
unable to teach them their language, and practically all speak English with
that peculiar drawl that has become familiar to us in Jamaica and other
islands in the West Indies. The blacks welcome the coming of Uncle Sam.
They look upon us as a Santa Claus, who will bring them untold blessings
and wealth beyond their dreams. They are a simple, childlike people, with
bodies of men and women but with the intellect of the average child.</p>

<h3><i>Charlotte Amalie</i></h3>

<p>Charlotte Amalie is a clean little town with regular streets, and buildings
built of stone and brick faced with cement. The Danes are a
cleanly, orderly people, and this
is evident in the appearance of
the towns on the islands.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD DANISH FORT, ST. THOMAS HARBOR</p>
</div>

<p>Hurricanes are frequent, and
at times do great damage. A
storm of several years ago unroofed
many of the houses, tore
down palm trees and destroyed
most of the foliage. Traces of
the hurricane may still be seen,
but its effect is gradually being
obliterated.</p>

<p>Many steamers have been
wrecked on these islands. Among
numerous sailors stranded on St.
Thomas was a Frenchman
named Louis Monsanto.
He founded on
the shore of Krum Bay
what he calls the
graveyard of ships.
Lying about are several
odd figureheads
that once adorned the
bows of lost boats.
Each has its story of
thrilling escapes and
tragic loss of life to awe
the listener.</p>

<p>Marines now police
the island, and to them
has been entrusted the task of
restoring order, mounting
guns for the protection of the
harbor, and firmly establishing
American rule.</p>

<h3><i>An Island Bluebeard</i></h3>

<p>These islands were once
infested by pirates; in Charlotte
Amalie we see Bluebeard’s
and Blackbeard’s
castles. An English pirate
who married a woman from
Charlotte Amalie went away
on one of his piratical expeditions,
entrusting to his wife
a small box which he told her
not to open unless he did not return in six months. After two months,
woman’s curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box. She
found therein just seven letters, but they were seven compromising letters
written by women of Charlotte Amalie. She did not kill her husband,
instead she invited the women to an afternoon tea at her home and
poisoned all seven. So, you see it was not, in this case, the man who
was the “bluebeard,” but the wife&mdash;a sort of bluebearded lady. She was
arrested, tried and convicted, and was condemned to be burned at the
stake. The eventful day arrived. Fagots were piled high about her, the
torch was about to be applied, when the pirate ship appeared in the harbor,
the pirate and his crew came ashore, and the wife was rescued. Then
she sailed away with her husband, and they “lived happily ever after.”</p>

<h3><i>St. John and St. Croix</i></h3>

<p>The smallest of the inhabited islands is St. John. The few people living
there are employed in picking bay leaves. The bay tree thrives on the
island, and the oil obtained from its leaf is used in the making of bay rum.</p>

<p>The largest of the islands is St. Croix. It is about twenty-one miles
in length and from four to fourteen miles in width. Rich and fertile,
its soil produces chiefly sugar, a product capable of still further industrial
development. The principal difficulty encountered is in obtaining
good water. There is but one stream on the island,
and except for the water from this stream the people
must depend on rain water stored during the
rainy season. One of the first duties that we have
before us is the boring of artesian wells, as all the
islands are in great need of good water for drinking
and commercial purposes.</p>

<p class="caption">Christiansted, St. Croix</p>
</div>

<p>There is a primitive sugar mill on the island
of St. Croix that is owned by Danes. One of the
owners told me that the day the islands were
transferred to the United States the negro employees
formed a union and struck. They lost no
time in availing themselves of the advantages
that organized labor enjoys in a great republic.</p>

<p>The seat of government of this island is Christiansted,
a town of about 4500 people. It is a
neat, substantial little place, with covered colonnades
extending

<p>It was from
Frederiksted,
the chief port
of St. Croix,
that Alexander
Hamilton came
to America.
Born on the
island of St. Nevis, his mother
died when he was still an infant.
He was then sent to an
aunt who lived on St. Croix,
and it was there that he gave
evidence of the brilliant mind
that in later years made him
one of the most conspicuous
figures in American history.
It is a strange coincidence
that over a hundred years
after Hamilton left St. Croix
it should come into possession
of the nation he served so
brilliantly. What might George Washington, “The Father of his Country,”
say if he could know that the birthplace of the young West Indian
attorney, to whom he looked for legal counsel, was now part of the great republic
in whose establishment each of them had such an important share?</p>

<p>There is but one paved highway on St. Croix, and that extends from
Christiansted to Frederiksted at the west end of the island. A macadam
road twenty-one miles in length connects the two towns, and over this
highway passes practically all the traffic on the island. Here we see a
curious procession of natives driving all kinds of queer vehicles drawn
by diminutive ponies or donkeys.</p>

<p>Women carry upon their heads loads that would stagger the average
man. They are able to balance almost anything, and one sees them carrying
boxes, barrels, and even pianos, although the latter require about
four women to balance their weight.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, St. Croix offers a good field for development. Cotton
as well as sugar can be
grown profitably, and, with
modern American methods,
its products can be materially
increased.</p>

<h3><i>System of Education</i></h3>

<p>When the Americans first
took possession there was
much confusion. Danish law
conflicted with American law,
Danish customs differed from
American customs, there was
a Danish postmaster and an
American postmaster; but these things are now straightened out and
order has been completely restored.</p>

<p>The Danish method of instruction, which has long been in use, has
been continued by the United States. The system differs from our own
in that the schools are in session practically the year round, and religious
training is required. The religious training in the schools will be discontinued,
but otherwise the Danish method will obtain.</p>

<p>Virgin Islanders pride themselves on their low percentage of illiteracy.
Only about two per cent. of the inhabitants are unable to read and write.</p>

<h3><i>The Importance of St. Thomas</i></h3>

<p>Commercially, the island of St. Thomas is destined to play the most
important part of all the group, as it is a favored way-station on the
route from European ports to the Panama Canal. Its lost trade can be
regained, and it may be possible for American manufacturers to display
samples of their wares
in especially built ware-rooms
at Charlotte
Amalie. This would
enable the merchants
of Central and South
America to make their
purchases again as they
once did. It would obviate
the necessity of a
long journey to New
York, and the port
of St. Thomas would
be a convenient place
in which to see American-made
goods and place orders.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FORT ON THE HILL ABOVE CHARLOTTE AMALIE</p>

<p class="caption">Now an American jail</p>
</div>

<p>The gold paid by the United States
to Denmark for the Virgin Islands
weighed 48 tons. Like everything
else, the islands have gone up in
price since the first negotiations
undertaken, fifty years ago, but it
was necessary for us to have them,
as with St.
Thomas in our
possession and
fortified no foreign
power without
a naval base
in this part of the
world would dare attack the Panama Canal without
first capturing St. Thomas. Without it they would
leave a fortified base in their rear, an extremely dangerous
situation for an attacking force.</p>

<p>The value of the harbor of St. Thomas and its
strategic advantages have been recognized since the
days of the Spanish buccaneers. Once the headquarters
for ships sailing under the black flag, the
memories of those days will always form a romantic
and fascinating side of the life that was. Today
there are modern harbor works, floating docks, marine
slips and wharves provided with electric cranes, oil
reservoirs, coal depots, fresh-water tanks, machine
shops, and many other things that contribute to the
commercial advantage of St. Thomas as a port
of call.</p>

<p>We must not overlook the political importance
of extending American jurisdiction over islands
situated in the Caribbean Sea. The possibility
of a change of sovereignty of any of the islands
under foreign jurisdiction is of grave concern
to this country.</p>

<p>The Monroe Doctrine, a settled national
policy, would have caused this country to look
with disfavor upon the acquisition of the Danish
West Indies by any other power. The treaty of
cession of these islands to the United States is
therefore a matter of no small moment.</p>

<p>Previous to the
purchase, Rear Admiral
Casper F.
Goodrich thus defined
the advantages
of the transfer in an
interview in the New York <i>Times</i>. “Were
the Danish West Indies in the possession of
an enemy, what interests of ours would be
menaced? Let us seek the answers to this
momentous question. From them, as a
base, to Charleston, our nearest important
Atlantic harbor, is about 1200 miles; to
Norfolk about 1300 miles&mdash;distances easily
covered in three or four days by a fleet
which could fight an action and return with
plenty of fuel left in the bunkers. Moreover,
raiding operations therefrom, could,
and doubtless would, seriously interfere
with, if they didn’t
wholly interrupt,
our foreign commerce,
even at remote
points, such
as New York, Boston
and Portland.
In the other direction
lies Colon, a
little more than
one thousand miles
away from St.
Thomas. It is against Colon
that an inimical campaign would
more possibly be directed. The
possession of this gateway to
the Pacific would restore the conditions
of the war with Spain,
when the <i>Oregon</i> had to circumnavigate
the whole of South
America in order to join Sampson
off Santiago de Cuba.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>“It is evident that a foreign
nation endeavoring to acquire the
Danish West Indies could in fact
have no mere commercial or profitable
colonial aim in view. There is
but one harbor in the group that is
especially fit for a naval base&mdash;Charlotte
Amalie, on the south side
of St. Thomas. By skill and care it
could be made to accommodate a
fleet large enough to occasion us
grave concern. From a secure harbor
for merchant steamers to a naval
establishment and a military outpost,
the path is neither hard nor
long. It is wiser, however distasteful, to forestall any such manoeuver
by a foreign power by buying the islands ourselves. We do not relish the
idea of such a thorn in our side, such a threat to neighboring Porto Rico,
to our naval station at Guantanamo (only 300 miles distant), to that at
Key West (1000 miles distant), to the free navigation of the Caribbean
Sea, and the Mona and Windward Passages (between Porto Rico and Haiti,
Cuba and Porto Rico, respectively), or to our Gulf cities. Thus it appears,
north, east, south and
west, these islands are a most
valuable <i>point d’appui</i> for any
European government wishing
to quarrel with us. It is,
therefore, in the highest degree
essential that we spare
no effort to prevent their falling
into unfriendly hands.”</p>

<h3><i>Transportation</i></h3>

<p>Climatically the Virgin Islands
offer much to attract
the tourist as a winter resort.
They need first-class hotels, to be
built and managed by competent
Americans. There is no reason why
the islands should not become popular
with the tourist as soon as suitable
accommodations have been
provided.</p>

</div>

<p>Situated 1440 miles south of New
York and 1025 miles from Colon,
the northern entrance to the Panama
Canal, the islands are ideally placed
for a short sea voyage. The population
in recent years has been
diminishing, because of the loss of
trade and the consequent falling-off
of the number of ships in the harbor. At one time there were 46,000
people on the islands; in 1911, the number had dwindled to 27,000, and
the present population is said to approximate this figure.</p>

<p>The only means of transportation on St. John is by horseback. As the
island is very hilly, the roads are not suitable for vehicles. On St. Thomas
there are about fifteen miles of good roads, traversed by numerous carriages
and a few automobiles. St. Croix boasts one hundred miles of
roads, but few of these are paved.</p>

<p>We include in our West Indies possessions not only some of the
Virgin Islands, but Porto
Rico. Porto Rico, however,
is no more American today
than when we first went to
the island. But the Virgin
Islander welcomes the
United States. The circumstances
attending the purchase
and transfer of the
islands were most auspicious,
and we foresee only
the happiest outcome
from the relations between
the natives and the United
States.</p>

<p>When Mr. E. M. Newman, who is now in
Europe, returns, he will bring pictures and
information that will mean a great deal to
all the readers of The Mentor. Mr. Newman
had intended to resume his South
American series&mdash;which has been appearing
in The Mentor&mdash;and was about to sail to
the southern continent when he was summoned
to Washington and commissioned
by the United States Government to go
over and make a special study of war
conditions in England, France, and Italy.
Mr. Newman’s objective is not the trenches&mdash;there
are plenty of war correspondents
and battle photographers. His mission is
a distinctly new and important one. He
is to make a record, in pictures and text,
of the living conditions of the people in war
time as he observes them in the allied
countries. When he returns, this material
will be put at once before the public in a
series of lectures, the purpose being to
make clear to Americans just what war
means to those that are not “out there,”
but are doing their bit in the home city,
town, village, or farm district. Naturally,
this material will have tremendous vital interest
to all of us in the United States who
are watching and wondering what war is
going to mean in our daily lives and occupations.
“I hope particularly,” said Mr.
Newman, “to illustrate the conservation of
human power that makes possible the release
of able bodied men to the war with
the least disturbance to commerce. The
object is to bring back to the United States
a graphic presentation of what can be done
and what should be done to permit us to
utilize every ounce of our strength for the
successful prosecution of the war.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>The Mentor will publish Mr. Newman’s
material in three articles, entitled “England
in War Time,” “France in War Time,”
“Italy in War Time.” We expect to have
these important articles ready for publication
in the Fall&mdash;the dates will depend upon
the time of Mr. Newman’s return. On
the opposite page we print some interesting
information just
received from him.</p>

<h2>War Conditions in England</h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Newman sends us word from London that air raids there
are strengthening instead of weakening the morale of the British.
Few Londoners ever think of hiding in the bomb-proof
cellars when the enemy planes arrive, and when the warning
signal is given the entire population rushes to the roofs of buildings and
other points of vantage to watch the fight. Mr. Newman witnessed a
night air raid on London. “For fear that I might miss something,” he
writes, “I went up on the roof of a building and watched the searchlights
and saw the flash of the many anti-aircraft guns. The boom of
cannon and the whirr of the machines was an inspiring spectacle. I
must say that the British airmen are perfectly wonderful. I watched
with intense excitement several battles in the air, during which I saw
flashes of fire from the machine guns which the British flyers were
using to destroy the German planes. Seven of the invaders were
brought down, and while I regret that any got away, I think the result
was most gratifying. Were it not for the loss of life and the destruction
of property, I would like to see another raid.”</p>

<p>Mr. Newman, accompanied by a British major, made a tour of the
English provinces, where millions of women are engaged in war work.
“The women of England,” writes Mr. Newman, “are working very hard;
they are doing work that few people would believe women capable of
performing. I have a picture of women workers in Glasgow forging
steel ingots. Women make shells of every size, run huge machines of
every description, build hydro and aeroplanes, do carpentry work,
blacksmithing, painting, and, in fact, almost every phase of labor formerly
done by men. I have obtained pictures of the Land Army composed of
women doing all kinds of heavy farm work, such as harnessing horses, and
ploughing. In Edinburgh I photographed some quaint street scenes showing
the motor buses with huge gas bags on top to take the place of petrol.
I went to Ilford, where I photographed girls working on engines as stokers,
oilers and cleaners. The American Y.M.C.A. Hut in London is a
very busy center, where our boys are entertained and cared for. I have
a pretty picture of an American girl making flapjacks for some of our
sailor boys. Other pictures I have show girl chauffeurs, ‘Penguins’ or
Royal Air Force Girls, girl messengers, porters, and a girl driving an electric
truck. Londoners are ‘carrying on’ cheerfully, and at the same time
are enjoying theaters and other such pleasures as life in wartime permits.”</p>
